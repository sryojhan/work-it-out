## 🎯 Goal

Work It Out is designed to help users quickly generate effective workout routines by selecting targeted muscle groups. It aims to provide a clean, user-friendly interface for casual gym-goers or beginners looking for structured plans without overcomplication.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

Users select one or more muscle groups from the interface. The app generates a routine by randomly selecting exercises from a local JSON database, organized by group and sub-section (e.g., chest → upper, lower, flys). The algorithm favors underrepresented subgroups to create balanced sessions.

Everything runs client-side with no backend — transitions are instant and the app loads in milliseconds thanks to Vite and its lightweight structure.
